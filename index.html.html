Target
LOCAL IS GOOD
<li> Local is Lekker. South Africans get to know their country by visiting the local places. They should also play their part as the citizens by loving and implementing maintenance to the country. For example, the infrastructures, heritage places and so on, not just for tourists but also for future generation.
They should also be aware of their country' economy and so be advised to invest.</li>
